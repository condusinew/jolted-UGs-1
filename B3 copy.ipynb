    "## Metaphor for Understanding Linked Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand linked lists, let's consider a metaphor. Imagine yourself as a psychologist who is conducting a research study. Each participant in your study is like a node in a linked list. Each participant has a unique set of data that you've collected—like the data stored in a node—and each participant may refer you to the next participant in your study—like the pointer in a node of a linked list.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a singly linked list, each participant can only refer you to the next participant, not the previous one. This is analogous to each node storing a reference to the next node, but not the previous one. \n",
    "\n",
    "Conducting your research study is like traversing a linked list. You start with the first participant (the head of the list), collect and analyze their data, and then ask them to refer you to the next participant. You continue this process until you've visited every participant (or node in the list). In a linked list, this is akin to starting at the head node and following each node's pointer to the next node, until you reach the end of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, what if a participant drops out of your study or you add a new participant? That's like deleting or inserting a node in a linked list. If a participant drops out, you need to update your records so that the participant who referred you to the dropout instead refers you to the dropout's referral. In a linked list, you would change the pointer of the node before the one being deleted so that it points to the node after the deleted one.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you add a new participant, you need to ask one of your existing participants to refer you to the new one before their current referral. This is like inserting a new node into a linked list: you update the pointer of an existing node so that it points to the new node, and update the pointer of the new node so that it points to the node that was previously next.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's the basic concept of a singly linked list. In a doubly linked list, each participant can refer you to both the next participant and the previous one. This requires more effort to manage, but it also allows you to move backwards through your study participants if needed, which is like traversing backwards through a doubly linked list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding these concepts will be very helpful when we start coding linked lists in Python. Keep this metaphor in mind as we move forward and remember, each node (or participant) in the list has data and a pointer (or referral) to the next node."

    "# A Concrete Understanding of the Syntax of Linked Lists in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a linked list is a linear collection of data elements, which are not stored at contiguous memory locations. The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating a Node\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by creating a `Node` class which will serve as the foundation for our linked list. Each node will hold some data and a reference to the next node in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Node:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, data=None):\n",
    "        self.data = data\n",
    "        self.next = None\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this code block, we are defining the `Node` class. The `__init__` method, is a special method in Python classes, it is the constructor method for a class. The `self` parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, and is used to access class variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "This `Node` class has two parts, `data` and `next`. `data` will store the data of the node and `next` is the pointer that will point to the next node.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating a LinkedList Class\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's create a `LinkedList` class that will use the `Node` object to create the linked list and include methods to insert, print out, and remove nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class LinkedList:\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self.head = Node()\n",
    "        \n",
    "    def append(self, data):\n",

    "            prev.next = curr_node.next\n",
    "            curr_node = None\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `LinkedList` class, `append` method is used to add data at the end of the linked list. The `display` method is used to print the linked list, and the `remove` method is used to remove a node whose data is equal to the data passed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that linked lists in Python do not have to be manually linked together like in lower-level languages such as C. In Python, we can simply adjust where the `next` attribute of a node points.\n",
    "\n",
    "This syntax should provide a solid foundation for working with linked lists in Python. There's a lot more you can do with this structure, so feel free to experiment and expand upon this base class."
