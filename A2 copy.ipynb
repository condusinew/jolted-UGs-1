    "# Conceptual Understanding of Asynchronous Programming in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Metaphor\n",
    "\n",
    "Picture a psychologist conducting a group therapy session. The psychologist is the program, and each patient in the session represents an individual task or function within the program. In a traditional synchronous program, the psychologist would give their full attention to one patient at a time, much like a program executing one function at a time. The psychologist would listen to a patient's issue, provide advice or treatment, and only then move onto the next patient. This is much like a synchronous program that executes each function in order, one after another.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in the world of Python programming, we have a more efficient way of doing things - asynchronous programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "In an asynchronous setup, the psychologist could change their approach. Instead of focusing on one patient at a time, they could start an exercise with one patient, then while that patient is working on their exercise, the psychologist could move on to the next patient. This way, the psychologist is not idle while the patient is doing their exercise, but instead, they're using that time to start another patient on their exercise. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is the essence of asynchronous programming. While one task is waiting to get something it needs, like data from a user or a file, the program doesn't just sit there and wait. It goes on to start or continue other tasks. Then, when the data arrives, the program goes back to the waiting task and completes it. This is why asynchronous programming is often associated with the term \"non-blocking\".\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Event Loop\n",
    "The event loop is like the psychologist's internal planner. It keeps track of all the patients and what they're doing. When a patient has finished their exercise (i.e., a task has completed its operation or received the data it was waiting for), the event loop makes a note and informs the psychologist to attend to that patient.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Coroutines\n",
    "Coroutines in Python are like the exercises or treatments that the psychologist assigns to the patients. They're blocks of code that can be started, paused, and resumed, much like how the psychologist can start a patient on an exercise, leave them to work on it, and return later to check their progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future Objects\n",
    "Future objects are like the patients themselves. They represent a result that doesn't exist yet but is expected in the future. When the psychologist assigns an exercise to a patient, the expected result is the completion of the exercise, which will be achieved in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tasks\n",
    "Tasks are a subtype of Future. In our metaphor, you can think of Tasks as patients who have been assigned an exercise and are actively working on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, asynchronous programming is all about efficiency and making the most of waiting times. By understanding these key concepts and how they interact, you can start to create more efficient Python programs that handle multiple tasks simultaneously."

    "## Step 1: Introduction to Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with a simple example of asynchronous syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import asyncio\n",
    "\n",
    "async def main():\n",
    "    print('Hello')\n",
    "    await asyncio.sleep(1)\n",
    "    print('World')\n",
    "\n",
    "asyncio.run(main())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `async` keyword before the function definition `def main()` indicates that this is an asynchronous function or a \"coroutine\". The `await` keyword in the line `await asyncio.sleep(1)` signifies that Python can switch to executing something else while this operation waits for completion. The `asyncio.run(main())` is used to execute our asynchronous function.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2: Understanding Awaitables\n",
    "\n",
    "In asynchronous programming, an object is an `awaitable` if it can be used in an `await` expression. There are three main types of awaitable objects: coroutines, Tasks, and Futures.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import asyncio\n",
    "\n",
    "async def nested():\n",
    "    return 42\n",
    "\n",
    "async def main():\n",
    "    nested()  \n",
    "    print(await nested()) \n",
    "\n",
    "asyncio.run(main())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `nested()` is a coroutine. When called, it doesn't run but it returns a coroutine object. The `await` keyword is used before `nested()`, so the coroutine actually runs and returns '42'.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 3: Asynchronous Context Managers and Asynchronous Iterators\n",
    "\n",
    "The `async with` statement is used for asynchronous context managers. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import aiohttp\n",
    "import asyncio\n",
    "\n",
    "async def fetch(session, url):\n",
    "    async with session.get(url) as response:\n",
    "        return await response.text()\n",
    "\n",
    "async def main():\n",
    "    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:\n",
    "        html = await fetch(session, 'http://python.org')\n",
    "        print(html)\n",
    "\n",
    "asyncio.run(main())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the `aiohttp.ClientSession()` is an asynchronous context manager that manages the creation and destruction of a session.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `async for` statement is used for asynchronous iterators.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import asyncio\n",
    "\n",
    "async def ticker(delay, to):\n",
    "    for i in range(to):\n",
    "        yield i\n",
    "        await asyncio.sleep(delay)\n",
    "\n",
    "async def main():\n",
    "    async for i in ticker(1, 5):\n",
    "        print(i)\n",
    "\n",
    "asyncio.run(main())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `ticker` function, we use the `yield` keyword to make it an asynchronous generator. It's used in the `async for` loop in the `main()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 4: Creating Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "Tasks are used to schedule coroutines concurrently.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import asyncio\n",
    "\n",
    "async def count():\n",
    "    await asyncio.sleep(1)\n",
    "    print('World')\n",
    "\n",
    "async def main():\n",
    "    task1 = asyncio.create_task(count())\n",
    "    task2 = asyncio.create_task(count())\n",
    "    await task1\n",
    "    await task2\n",
    "\n",
    "asyncio.run(main())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we use `asyncio.create_task()` to schedule the execution of a coroutine. The tasks run concurrently, and the `await` keyword is used to wait until they complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that asynchronous programming can make your programs more efficient by allowing them to do multiple things at the same time. The key to understanding is to remember that `await` allows your program to multitask, and `asyncio` provides high-level APIs to manage this multitasking."

    "# Example 1: Using Asynchrony in Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "As a psychology student, you'll often need to handle large data sets. Let's say you have a list of 1000 URLs, each containing a JSON object with data from a psychological study, and you need to retrieve and analyze all of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a synchronous program, you would retrieve and process each URL one at a time. However, with asynchronous programming, you can retrieve and process multiple URLs simultaneously, drastically reducing the time taken.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by importing the necessary modules:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import aiohttp\n",
    "import asyncio\n",
    "import json\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now, let's define a function that makes an HTTP GET request to a URL and returns the response data:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "async def fetch(session, url):\n",
    "    async with session.get(url) as response:\n",
    "        return await response.text()\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this function, `session.get(url)` is a blocking operation that would normally stop the program until it completes. However, by using `await`, we tell Python to work on something else in the meantime, if possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's use this function to fetch data from a list of URLs:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "async def fetch_all(urls):\n",
    "    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:\n",
    "        tasks = []\n",
    "        for url in urls:\n",
    "            tasks.append(fetch(session, url))\n",
    "        responses = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)\n",
    "        return responses\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, we create a task for each URL and then use `asyncio.gather()` to run these tasks concurrently. The `await` keyword tells Python to wait until all tasks complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we can call our function with a list of URLs. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "urls = ['http://example.com/data1.json', 'http://example.com/data2.json', ...]\n",
    "loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()\n",
    "data = loop.run_until_complete(fetch_all(urls))\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, `fetch_all(urls)` is a coroutine that returns immediately. To actually run the coroutine, we need to use an event loop, which we get with `asyncio.get_event_loop()`. Then, we run the coroutine with `loop.run_until_complete()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The variable `data` now contains the data from all URLs, ready for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example 2: Asynchronous Web Scraping\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common task in psychology is web scraping - extracting data from websites. This could be used, for example, to gather articles from online newspapers for text analysis or sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like in the previous example, we can use asynchronous programming to scrape multiple web pages simultaneously:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n",
    "\n",
    "async def scrape(session, url):\n",
    "    response = await fetch(session, url)\n",
    "    soup = BeautifulSoup(response, 'html.parser')\n",
    "    return soup.find_all('p')  # Extract all paragraphs\n",
    "\n",
    "async def scrape_all(urls):\n",
    "    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:\n",
    "        tasks = []\n",
    "        for url in urls:\n",
    "            tasks.append(scrape(session, url))\n",
    "        pages = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)\n",
    "        return pages\n",
    "\n",
    "urls = ['http://example.com/page1.html', 'http://example.com/page2.html', ...]\n",
    "loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()\n",
    "pages = loop.run_until_complete(scrape_all(urls))\n",
    "```\n",
    "Again, we're using the same basic pattern: create a list of tasks, run them concurrently with `asyncio.gather()`, and wait for all tasks to complete with `await`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The variable `pages` now contains the scraped data from all web pages, ready for text analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, always respect the website's robots.txt file and don't overload the server with too many requests!\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, by using asynchronous programming, you can make your Python programs more efficient by doing multiple things at once. This is especially useful in data analysis and web scraping, where you often need to handle large amounts of data."

    "Problem Description:\n",
    "\n",
    "Psychologists often need to conduct multiple surveys at the same time. They want to start the next survey only when the current one is completed. However, there can be delays in response from the participants which can lead to inefficient use of time if conducted sequentially.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a psychologist and beginner programmer, your task is to simulate this scenario using asynchronous programming in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "Create a Python program that simulates conducting multiple surveys concurrently. Each survey should be represented as a separate asynchronous function that waits for a random period of time (to simulate waiting for survey completion) before it finishes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your program should be able to start and manage any number of surveys. The program should print a message when a survey starts, and another message when a survey finishes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, your program should not start the next survey until the current one has completed. This means that if five surveys are started at the same time, the program should print five start messages, then five end messages in the order that they were started.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to handle exceptions properly, as real-world programming often involves unexpected interruptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your solution should take advantage of Python's asyncio library to handle the asynchronous tasks. This problem will test your understanding of asynchronous programming concepts and your ability to apply them in a practical context.\n",
