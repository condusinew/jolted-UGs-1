    "# Conceptual Understanding of Linked Lists in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "### Metaphorical Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's think of a linked list as a treasure hunt game. In this game, you start at a specific point, and at each point, there's a clue that leads you to the next point. You follow the clues one after the other until you reach the treasure. In the context of linked lists, the starting point is called the `head`, the clues are `pointers` and the points or clues are the `nodes`. The treasure could be seen as the `end` or `tail` of the list, or a particular node you're searching for. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a `singly linked list`, you can only move in one direction, just like in our treasure hunt game where you move from clue to clue in the order they're given. You can't go back to a previous clue unless you restart the game or keep a record of the past clues. Similarly, in a singly linked list, you can only traverse the list in one direction - from the head to the tail.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, imagine a more advanced treasure hunt in which each clue not only leads you to the next one but also has a reference to the previous clue. This would be like a `doubly linked list`, where each node has a pointer to both the next node and the previous node. This allows you to move in both directions along the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a `circular linked list`, our treasure hunt becomes an endless loop. The last clue doesn't lead to the treasure, but back to the first clue, creating a circle. Similarly, in a circular linked list, the pointer of the tail node leads back to the head node.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of each node as a box in our treasure hunt. Inside the box, there are two compartments. One compartment holds the clue, which we can liken to the `data` of the node. The other compartment contains a map to the next box, similar to the `pointer` in a node.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a doubly linked list, the box has an additional compartment that contains a map to the previous box. This is akin to an additional pointer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Operations on Linked Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Adding an element**: To add an element to our treasure hunt, we create a new box (or node), put something inside it (the data), and place it at the desired location. We then update the map (pointer) in the previous box to lead to this new box and the map in the new box to lead to the next one.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Removing an element**: To remove an element, we find the box we want to remove and update the map in the box before it to lead to the box after it. We then remove the box. In a doubly linked list, we'd also need to update the map in the box after it to point to the box before it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Searching for an element**: To search for an element, we start at the first box and open each box to check if the item inside matches what we're looking for. If it does, great! If not, we move to the next box, following the map.\n",
    "\n",
    "This metaphorical explanation should give you a conceptual understanding of linked lists in Python. In subsequent modules, we will delve into the code and implement these operations."

    "## Node Creation\n",
    "\n",
    "The building block of a linked list is a node, which consists of two parts: a data field and a reference to the next node. Here's how we can construct a Node class in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Node:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, data=None):\n",
    "        self.data = data\n",
    "        self.next = None\n",
    "```\n",
    "The `__init__` method initializes a new instance of the class. The data parameter will hold the data for the node, while the next parameter is set to None initially because when we create a node, we do not know what the next node will be.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Linked List Creation\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have a Node, we can create a LinkedList class that will use the Node object. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class LinkedList:\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self.head = None\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The LinkedList class has a single property: head, which points to the first node in the linked list. When we initialize the LinkedList, it starts without nodes, so head is set to None.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Insertion Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to add data to a linked list, but we will focus on two methods: appending data to the end and prepending data at the beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class LinkedList:\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self.head = None\n",
    "\n",
    "    def append(self, data):\n",
    "        if not self.head:\n",
    "            self.head = Node(data)\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            curr = self.head\n",
    "            while curr.next:\n",
    "                curr = curr.next\n",
    "            curr.next = Node(data)\n",
    "            \n",
    "    def prepend(self, data):\n",
    "        new_node = Node(data)\n",
    "        new_node.next = self.head\n",
    "        self.head = new_node\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `append` method checks if the list is empty; if it is, it creates a new head node. If it isn't, it iterates through the list until it reaches the end, then adds a new node at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `prepend` method creates a new node and sets its next field to the current head of the list. It then sets the list's head to the new node, effectively adding it to the front of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Displaying the List\n",
    "\n",
    "To visualize the list, we can create a method to print out its elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class LinkedList:\n",
    "    # ...\n",
    "    def display(self):\n",
    "        curr = self.head\n",
    "        while curr:\n",
    "            print(curr.data, end=' ')\n",
    "            curr = curr.next\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting from the head, `display` method traverses the list and prints the data at each node until it reaches the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you understand the fundamental operations and syntax of linked lists in Python, you can explore more complex operations like insertion at a specific position, deletion, and searching."

    "Problem: Implement a Music Playlist Manager using Linked Lists in Python\n",

    "1. `add_song(id, title, artist, duration)`: Adds a new song to the end of the playlist.\n",

    "2. `remove_song(id)`: Removes a song from the playlist using the song's unique ID.\n",
