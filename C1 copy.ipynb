    "## A Conceptual Understanding of Loops in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In computer programming, a loop is a control structure that allows a piece of code to be executed repeatedly. To illustrate the concept of loops in Python, let's make use of an analogy related to video game design, which is familiar territory for most of you.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Game Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the main game loop, an essential part of every video game. In each iteration of the game loop, the game's state is updated based on player inputs, AI behavior, and other factors. Then, the game's visuals are updated to reflect this new state. This process repeats over and over, typically dozens of times per second, until the game is eventually exited.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is fundamentally the same as a loop in Python. You define a set of instructions (like updating the game state and visuals), and these instructions are executed over and over again until a specific condition is met (like the game being exited). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Loops in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of loops in Python: the `for` loop and the `while` loop. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### The 'for' loop\n",
    "\n",
    "A `for` loop in Python behaves like a game loop where you have a clear idea of how many times the loop should run. For instance, imagine a game where the player has to jump over ten consecutive obstacles. The action of jumping over an obstacle can be considered a loop iteration, and since you know there are exactly ten obstacles, the loop will run ten times.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The 'while' loop\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, a `while` loop in Python is similar to a game loop that continues indefinitely until a specific condition is met. This is like the main game loop we discussed earlier. The game continues to run, constantly updating its state and visuals, until an exit condition is met - for example, the player choosing to quit the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nested Loops \n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes in game design, we have loops within loops. For instance, a game might have multiple levels, and each level might have multiple enemies for the player to defeat. To model this in code, we could use a loop to iterate over each level, and inside that loop, we could use another loop to iterate over each enemy within the current level. This concept is known as nested looping.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Break and Continue \n",
    "\n",
    "In some situations in our game, we may want to exit a loop prematurely or skip to the next iteration without completing the rest of the loop's code. This is where the `break` and `continue` statements come in.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a player achieves a certain score, we may want to 'break' out of our game loop and move them to the next level. Alternatively, if a player encounters an invincible enemy, we might want to 'continue' to the next enemy without executing the code that handles the player's attack.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, understanding loops in Python is much like understanding the flow of a video game. They both involve repeating a set of instructions until a certain condition is met, which is a fundamental concept in both programming and game design."

    "# The Anatomy of Loops in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "As a videogame designer, you constantly deal with repetitive tasks, whether it's moving a character across the screen, processing player inputs or generating multiple game entities. In Python, one of the ways to handle such repetition is by using loops. Let's dissect the syntax of Python loops, specifically the `for` and `while` loops, using examples related to videogame design.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The For Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "The `for` loop in Python is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, dictionary, set, or string) or other iterable objects. The basic syntax is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for variable in sequence:\n",
    "  # code to be executed\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's imagine you are designing a game where you need to spawn multiple enemies at different locations. You could have a list of these locations and use a for loop to spawn an enemy at each location.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "enemy_locations = [(10, 20), (30, 40), (50, 60)]\n",
    "\n",
    "for location in enemy_locations:\n",
    "    spawn_enemy(location)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `location` is the variable that takes the value of the current element in the sequence for each iteration. `enemy_locations` is our sequence, and `spawn_enemy(location)` is the code to be executed on each iteration. \n",
    "\n",
    "## The While Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "The `while` loop in Python is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a certain condition is true. The basic syntax is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "while condition:\n",
    "  # code to be executed\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a scenario in a game where a player's character loses health over time until their health reaches zero. This could be represented using a while loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "player_health = 100\n",
    "\n",
    "while player_health > 0:\n",
    "    player_health -= 1\n",
    "    print('Player health:', player_health)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `player_health > 0` is the condition that controls the loop. As long as this condition is true, the code within the loop is executed. The code inside the loop reduces the player's health by 1 each time it runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, `for` and `while` loops in Python provide a way to automate repetitive tasks. The `for` loop is generally used when you know how many times you want to iterate, and the `while` loop is used when you want to continue until a specific condition is met. By understanding and using loops, you can create more complex and interactive videogames."

    "# Example 1: Game Character Movement\n",
    "\n",
    "In video games, character movement is an essential aspect. Let's learn how to use loops to simulate a character's movement in a game environment. We'll use a grid to represent the game's board and a character's position will be defined by its x and y coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Define initial position\n",
    "x_pos = 0\n",
    "y_pos = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define the steps\n",
    "steps = [('right', 3), ('up', 2), ('left', 1), ('down', 2)]\n",
    "\n",
    "for direction, distance in steps:\n",
    "    if direction == 'up':\n",
    "        y_pos += distance\n",

    "\n",
    "print(f\"Final position is ({x_pos}, {y_pos})\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this code, we are using a `for` loop to iterate over the list of steps. For each step, we check the direction and update the x or y coordinate accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example 2: Enemy Spawn\n",
    "\n",
    "In video games, enemies often spawn at regular intervals. We can use a `while` loop to simulate this.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import time\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define the initial number of enemies\n",
    "enemies = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define the maximum number of enemies\n",
    "max_enemies = 10\n",
    "\n",
    "# Spawn enemies until we reach the maximum\n",
    "while enemies < max_enemies:\n",
    "    print(f\"Spawning enemy number {enemies + 1}...\")\n",
    "    enemies += 1\n",
    "    time.sleep(1)  # wait for 1 second\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Maximum number of enemies spawned!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this code, we're using a `while` loop to keep spawning enemies until we reach the maximum. The `time.sleep(1)` function is used to pause the execution of the loop for 1 second between spawns.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example 3: Scoring System\n",
    "\n",
    "In games, players often earn points for completing certain actions or objectives. We can use a `for` loop to calculate the total score based on a list of completed objectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Define the points for each objective\n",
    "objectives = {\"collect gem\": 50, \"defeat enemy\": 100, \"find treasure\": 500}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define the completed objectives\n",
    "completed_objectives = [\"collect gem\", \"defeat enemy\", \"collect gem\", \"find treasure\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calculate the total score\n",
    "total_score = 0\n",
    "for objective in completed_objectives:\n",
    "    total_score += objectives[objective]\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f\"Total score is {total_score}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this code, we're using a `for` loop to iterate over the list of completed objectives. For each completed objective, we add the corresponding points to the total score."

    "Problem: \n",
    "\n",
    "In a popular video game that you are designing, there is a feature where the player needs to collect coins to increase their score. The player can collect between 1 to 100 coins randomly placed in each level. You are tasked to write a Python program that simulates this scenario.\n",

    "Your program should do the following:\n",

    "1. Generate a random number between 1 and 100 to represent the number of coins in the level. Use the random.randint() function for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use a loop to simulate the player collecting the coins. The loop should run as many times as there are coins. For each iteration, print a message saying \"Coin collected!\". It should also keep a count of the total number of coins collected.\n",
