    "# Conceptual Understanding of Asynchronous Programming in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Symphony of Asynchronous Programming\n",
    "Let's try to understand asynchronous programming in Python with a metaphor that might be familiar and interesting to you - a symphony orchestra. In a symphony orchestra, there are numerous musicians playing different instruments, each having its own specific part to play in the overall piece. A conductor guides the orchestra, ensuring each musician knows when to start, stop or change their pace. However, not all musicians are playing at the same time; some might be waiting for their turn, while others are playing. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is quite similar to asynchronous programming. Here, different parts of a program (tasks) are like the musicians: they have specific jobs to do, and they do not necessarily operate concurrently. An 'orchestra', in Python, could be a program with several tasks that need to be completed. 'Musicians' are the tasks or functions that are to be executed, and the 'conductor' is the event loop, which controls when each task starts, pauses, or resumes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Event Loop: The Conductor\n",
    "The event loop, much like a conductor, is the core of any asynchronous program. It schedules and controls the execution of all tasks. When a task is waiting for an operation to complete (like a musician waiting for their turn), it yields control back to the event loop (the conductor), which can then run other tasks (other musicians can play). Once the operation is complete, the task resumes (the musician starts playing again). This mechanism prevents the entire program from stalling while waiting for a single operation to complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tasks: The Musicians\n",
    "Tasks in asynchronous programming are independent units of work, much like the musicians in an orchestra. They do their job without concerning themselves with when or how the other tasks are executed. In Python, a task is typically a function defined with async def. When called, this function doesn't actually run but instead returns a coroutine object. The coroutine object is then managed and executed by the event loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Art of Asynchronous Programming\n",
    "In synchronous (or traditional) programming, tasks are like a solo musician, they perform one after the other, each one waiting for the previous to finish. In asynchronous programming, tasks are like an orchestra, with multiple tasks being managed simultaneously, making efficient use of time and resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, the goal of asynchronous programming is not necessarily to perform multiple tasks simultaneously (that is parallelism, a different concept). The goal is to maintain progress, or to keep the 'music' playing, even when some parts of the program are idle or waiting for something else to happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the upcoming sections, we will delve deeper into the specifics of how Python handles asynchronous programming, including the async/await syntax, the asyncio library, and more. By the end, you should be able to conduct your own 'asynchronous symphony'."

    "Asynchronous programming in Python is a programming design that has to do with the construction of applications to perform separate tasks independently without blocking or waiting for the previous task to complete. This approach is particularly useful in tasks that are IO-bound, like networking, where waiting for response from a network request can take significant time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python has introduced native support for asynchronous operations in Python 3.5+ via two keywords: `async` and `await`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's dive into the anatomy of asynchronous programming in Python with an example. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import asyncio\n",
    "\n",
    "async def main():\n",
    "    print('Hello')\n",
    "    await asyncio.sleep(1)\n",
    "    print('World')\n",
    "\n",
    "asyncio.run(main())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of the syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `import asyncio`: This imports Python's built-in asynchronous IO library. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. `async def main()`: Here, `async def` introduces either a native coroutine or an asynchronous generator. The `async def` syntax is for defining a coroutine function. A coroutine function is a special type of function that can be paused and resumed, allowing it to be non-blocking. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. `print('Hello')`: This is a simple print statement that prints 'Hello' to the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `await asyncio.sleep(1)`: The `await` keyword is used to pause the execution of the coroutine until the `asyncio.sleep(1)` function completes. `await` only works inside `async def` functions and is used to denote something that is time-consuming and should be done asynchronously. In this case, we're telling the function to wait for 1 second.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `print('World')`: Another print statement that prints 'World' to the console. This line is executed after the await operation is done.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. `asyncio.run(main())`: This is the event loop driving the coroutine. The event loop is the core of every asyncio application. It is responsible for executing coroutines and scheduling callbacks. Here, we're using `asyncio.run()`, which is an asynchronous version of a main entry point, to execute the `main` coroutine.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a simple example of using asynchronous programming in Python. The key takeaway is understanding the role of `async` and `await`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`async` declares a function to be a coroutine, which can be paused and resumed, allowing other tasks to run during waiting periods. \n",
    "\n",
    "`await` is used to call these declared coroutine functions and wait for them to complete. If you come from a JavaScript background, `async` and `await` in Python work very similarly to how they work in JavaScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "Asynchronous programming is a powerful tool, especially for IO-bound tasks, and understanding its syntax is the first step in leveraging its capabilities."

    "# Example 1: Asynchronous Web Scraper with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Asynchronous programming can be very effective in web scraping where I/O operations (like network requests) are often much slower than CPU operations. This is a common real-world problem where the speed of the operation matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import aiohttp\n",
    "import asyncio\n",
    "\n",
    "# URLs to scrape\n",
    "urls = ['http://example.com/page1', 'http://example.com/page2', 'http://example.com/page3']\n",
    "\n",
    "async def fetch_page(session, url):\n",
    "    async with session.get(url) as response:\n",
    "        return await response.text()\n",
    "\n",
    "async def main():\n",
    "    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:\n",
    "        tasks = []\n",
    "        for url in urls:\n",
    "            tasks.append(fetch_page(session, url))\n",
    "        pages = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)\n",
    "        return pages\n",
    "\n",
    "# Run the asyncio event loop\n",
    "pages = asyncio.run(main())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this code, `fetch_page` sends a GET request to a URL and retrieves the response text. `main` creates an aiohttp session, then creates a list of tasks to fetch each URL. It then waits for all tasks to complete using `asyncio.gather`. Finally, `asyncio.run` starts the asyncio event loop and runs `main`. This allows all pages to be fetched in parallel, greatly speeding up the overall operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example 2: Asynchronous Data Processing with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common use case for asynchronous programming is processing a large amount of data. Suppose we have a function `process_data` that takes a long time to run, and we want to run it on a large list of data. We can use asyncio to run the function on multiple pieces of data at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import asyncio\n",
    "\n",
    "# Data to process\n",
    "data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "\n",
    "async def process_data(x):\n",
    "    # Simulate a long-running process\n",
    "    await asyncio.sleep(1)\n",
    "    return x * x\n",
    "\n",
    "async def main():\n",
    "    tasks = []\n",
    "    for x in data:\n",
    "        tasks.append(process_data(x))\n",
    "    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)\n",
    "    return results\n",
    "\n",
    "# Run the asyncio event loop\n",
    "results = asyncio.run(main())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this code, `process_data` is a simulated long-running process. `main` creates a list of tasks to process each piece of data, then waits for all tasks to complete using `asyncio.gather`. Finally, `asyncio.run` starts the asyncio event loop and runs `main`. This allows all data to be processed in parallel, greatly speeding up the overall operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that the actual usage of asynchronous programming will vary depending on the specific programming task. However, the above examples provide a general idea of how you can use asyncio in Python to solve real-world problems more efficiently."

Your team is collecting real-time EEG (Electroencephalogram) data from multiple subjects participating in a study. The EEG device sends data every second to your system. Your task is to write a Python script that performs the following tasks asynchronously:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Receives real-time EEG data from multiple subjects simultaneously. Each subject's data should be handled by a separate asynchronous task.\n",
