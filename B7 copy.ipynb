    "# Linked Lists: A Conceptual Understanding with a Video Game Metaphor\n",
    "\n",
    "Linked lists are like a treasure hunt game, where each item gives you a clue to find the next one. Imagine you are playing a game that takes place in a large open world, and your mission is to find a sequence of items scattered across the game world.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Nodes: Items in the Game\n",
    "\n",
    "In this game, each item you have to find is like a `node` in a linked list. A node is a unit or an element of the list. Each node has two parts: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data**: This is just like the actual item you find in the game. It could be anything - a weapon, a potion, a piece of armor - the important thing is that it has some value.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Next**: This is like the clue attached to the item that points you to the next item. It could be a map, a riddle, or a set of coordinates - the important thing is that it leads you to the next node (item) in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Head: The Start of the Adventure\n",
    "\n",
    "The journey to find all the items starts from a specific location in the game world. This starting point is known as the `head` of the linked list. The head is not an item or node itself, but rather, it is a pointer that leads you to the first item/node in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Null: The End of the Adventure\n",
    "\n",
    "In our game, the last item you find has no clue attached to it, signifying the end of the treasure hunt. This is a bit like reaching a `null` pointer in a linked list. A null pointer indicates that you've reached the end of the list and there's no next node to move on to.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Traversal: The Journey Through the List\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of moving from one node to the next, guided by the clues, is similar to the `traversal` process in a linked list. Traversal is like the journey you undertake in the game to find all the items. You start at the head, move to the node it points to, then move to the next node pointed to by the current node's pointer, and so on, until you reach a node with a null pointer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Operations: Game Actions\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like in a game, where you can perform different actions (pick up items, use items, drop items), you can perform different `operations` on a linked list:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Insertion**: Adding a new node to the list is like finding a new item in the game. You can add the node at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Deletion**: Removing a node from the list is like dropping an item from your inventory. You can remove a node from any position in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Searching**: Looking for a particular node in the list is like searching for a specific item in your game world. You start at the head and traverse the list until you find the node you're looking for.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, linked lists are like a game: they're all about moving from one node to the next, following the clues and performing actions along the way. And just like a game, they can be fun and challenging to work with. Enjoy the journey!"

    "# Linked Lists in Python: Syntax Breakdown\n",
    "\n",
    "## Node Class\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental part of any linked list is the Node. Each node holds data and a reference (link) to the next node in the list. Let's start by defining a Python class for a Node.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Node:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, data=None):\n",
    "        self.data = data\n",
    "        self.next = None\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of a game, `data` could be a game character, an item, or any other element that you wish to track. `next` is a reference to the following node.\n",
    "\n",
    "## LinkedList Class\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we need a LinkedList class to manage our nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class LinkedList:\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self.head = None\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The LinkedList class only needs to keep track of a single node: the `head` of the list. In a gaming scenario, this could be the first element that gets loaded or the main character.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Insertion\n",
    "\n",
    "To add new data to our list, we'll add the `insert` method to our LinkedList class.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class LinkedList:\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    def insert(self, data):\n",
    "        if not self.head:\n",
    "            self.head = Node(data)\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            current = self.head\n",
    "            while current.next:\n",
    "                current = current.next\n",
    "            current.next = Node(data)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This method creates a new node with the given data, goes to the end of the list, and adds the new node to the end. In a game, this could be used to add a new enemy or item.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Traversal\n",
    "\n",
    "To view our list, we need a way to traverse it. We'll add a `print` method to our LinkedList class.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class LinkedList:\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    def print(self):\n",
    "        current = self.head\n",

    "            print(current.data)\n",
    "            current = current.next\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This method starts at the head of the list and goes through each node, printing its data, until it reaches the end of the list. In a game, this could be used to display the current state or score.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deletion\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we'll add a `delete` method to remove a Node from our list.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class LinkedList:\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    def delete(self, data):\n",
    "        if self.head is None:\n",
    "            return\n",
    "        if self.head.data == data:\n",
    "            self.head = self.head.next\n",
    "            return\n",
    "        current = self.head\n",
    "        while current.next:\n",
    "            if current.next.data == data:\n",
    "                current.next = current.next.next\n",
    "                return\n",
    "            current = current.next\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This method starts at the head of the list and goes through each node. If it finds a node with the specified data, it removes that node from the list. In a game, this could be used to remove a defeated enemy or a collected item.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, like in game design, data structures like linked lists are tools for you to use. How you implement them will depend on the rules and design of your game."

    "Problem: Design a Simple Inventory System for a Role-Playing Game (RPG)\n",
    "\n",
    "In many RPG type video games, the player has an inventory to store items like weapons, potions, armors, etc. These items can be attained in various ways such as by purchasing from a shop, looting from defeated enemies, or as rewards for completing quests. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to implement an inventory system for a simple RPG using a linked list in Python. The inventory system should have the following features:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Add Item**: The system should be able to add an item to the player’s inventory. Each item has a name, category (weapon, potion, armor, etc.), and quantity. If the player adds an item that already exists in their inventory, the system should increase the quantity of that item instead of adding a new node to the linked list.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Remove Item**: The player should be able to remove an item from their inventory. If the item quantity is more than one, the system should decrease the quantity. If the quantity is one, the item should be fully removed from the inventory.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Search Item**: The player should be able to search for an item in their inventory by item name.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Display Inventory**: The system should be able to display the player's entire inventory. The display should include item name, category, and quantity.\n",
