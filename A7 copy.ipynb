    "## Conceptual Understanding of Asynchronous Programming in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin by understanding the concept of 'asynchronous.' In the real world, you might have encountered situations where you start a task, then move on to other tasks before the first task finishes. For example, you put your coffee in the microwave to heat it up, and while it's heating, you start toasting your bread. You don't wait for the coffee to heat up before you start toasting. This is a simple example of asynchronous behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's bring this concept into the programming world. Imagine you're a chef in a busy kitchen (let's call this kitchen Python's runtime environment). You have several tasks to do: chop vegetables, grill a steak, boil pasta, bake a cake, and so forth. If you were to do these tasks one by one, you might find yourself waiting around a lot. You put the steak on the grill, but then you have to wait for it to cook before you can start chopping the vegetables. This is similar to synchronous programming: Python starts an operation (like a network request), waits for it to finish, and only then moves on to the next operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Asynchronous programming, on the other hand, is like having kitchen assistants. You put the steak on the grill, tell one assistant to watch it, and then you start chopping vegetables. Another assistant is boiling the pasta, and another is baking the cake. You're all working in the same kitchen, sharing the same resources, but tasks happen concurrently, not one after the other. This is the heart of asynchronous programming: starting a task, moving on to another task before the first one finishes, and managing all these tasks efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, these 'assistants' are known as coroutines. When you start a task (say, a network request), you can declare it as a coroutine. Python will then know it can pause this task, start another task, and come back to the first task when it's ready (like when the network request has received a response).\n",
    "\n",
    "But how does Python know when to pause and resume tasks? It uses something called an event loop, which is like our chef's to-do list. The chef checks the list, sees the next task, and starts it. If the task needs waiting (like waiting for the steak to cook), the chef leaves a note on the list (a 'callback'), starts another task, and comes back to the first task when it's ready. In Python, the event loop keeps track of all the tasks and their states, and knows when to switch between tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in a nutshell, asynchronous programming in Python is about efficiently managing multiple tasks. It's about starting a task, moving on to another one before the first one finishes, and doing all this in an organized, efficient manner. It's a powerful tool that can make your code more efficient and responsive, especially when dealing with many network requests or other I/O operations."

    "**Asynchronous Programming in Python: Syntax Breakdown**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore the syntax of asynchronous programming in Python through a concrete example. We'll be using the `asyncio` library, an asynchronous I/O framework that uses coroutines, multiplexing I/O access over sockets and other resources, running network clients and servers, and other related primitives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple asynchronous program in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import asyncio\n",
    "\n",
    "async def main():\n",
    "    print('Hello')\n",
    "    await asyncio.sleep(1)\n",
    "    print('World')\n",
    "\n",
    "asyncio.run(main())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax Breakdown:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Importing the asyncio module:** \n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    import asyncio\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    We start by importing the `asyncio` library, which provides the functionality we need for asynchronous programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Defining an asynchronous function:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    async def main():\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    To define an asynchronous function or a coroutine in Python, we use the `async def` syntax. This asynchronous function when called, doesn't execute immediately but instead it returns a coroutine object.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Coroutine Body:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    print('Hello')\n",
    "    await asyncio.sleep(1)\n",
    "    print('World')\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Inside the coroutine, we are performing two print operations with a pause in between. The `await` keyword is used to pause the coroutine until the awaited object is completed. In this case, `asyncio.sleep(1)` is a coroutine that pauses the execution for 1 second.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Running the coroutine:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    asyncio.run(main())\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    `asyncio.run()` is a convenience function to run the top-level asynchronous entry point. This function cannot be called when another asyncio event loop is running in the same thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A More Complex Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now look at a more complex example where we have multiple async functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import asyncio\n",
    "\n",
    "async def say_after(delay, what):\n",
    "    await asyncio.sleep(delay)\n",
    "    print(what)\n",
    "\n",
    "async def main():\n",
    "    print(f\"started at {time.strftime('%X')}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    await say_after(1, 'Hello')\n",
    "    await say_after(2, 'World')\n",
    "\n",
    "    print(f\"finished at {time.strftime('%X')}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "asyncio.run(main())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, `say_after` is another async function that waits for a specified delay time and then prints a message. In the `main` function, we are using `await` to call `say_after` function. This means that the `main` function will wait for `say_after` to complete before it moves to the next line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the `await` keyword is only valid inside `async def` functions. If you want to use asyncio APIs outside of async def functions, you must manually manage the event loop.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Remember, asynchronous programming allows you to write more efficient code by not blocking the execution of your program while waiting for I/O operations. This makes it a powerful tool for writing high-performance Python code, especially in the context of web development where you often have to handle many simultaneous connections."

    "# Example 1: Asynchronous File Reading\n",
    "Sometimes, you might need to read large files while not blocking the rest of your program. Here's how you can do it asynchronously.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import asyncio\n",
    "\n",
    "async def read_large_file(file_name):\n",
    "    with open(file_name, 'r') as f:\n",
    "        lines = await f.readlines()\n",

    "    print(lines)\n",
    "\n",
    "# To run the main function\n",
    "loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()\n",
    "loop.run_until_complete(main())\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, `read_large_file` is an asynchronous function that reads a file without blocking. The `await` keyword is used to pause the execution of the function until the awaited task is completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example 2: Asynchronous API Calls\n",
    "Async programming is very effective when dealing with I/O bound tasks like making API calls. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import aiohttp\n",
    "import asyncio\n",
    "\n",
    "async def fetch(session, url):\n",
    "    async with session.get(url) as response:\n",
    "        return await response.text()\n",
    "\n",
    "async def main():\n",
    "    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:\n",
    "        html = await fetch(session, 'http://python.org')\n",
    "        print(html)\n",
    "\n",
    "# To run the main function\n",
    "loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()\n",
    "loop.run_until_complete(main())\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, we are using the aiohttp library to make asynchronous HTTP requests. The fetch function is an asynchronous function that sends a GET request and awaits the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example 3: Concurrent Execution of Tasks\n",
    "Async programming also allows us to execute multiple tasks concurrently. Let's illustrate this with an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import asyncio\n",
    "\n",
    "async def count():\n",
    "    await asyncio.sleep(1)\n",
    "    print(\"One\")\n",
    "    await asyncio.sleep(1)\n",
    "    print(\"Two\")\n",
    "\n",
    "async def main():\n",
    "    await asyncio.gather(count(), count(), count())\n",
    "\n",
    "# To run the main function\n",
    "loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()\n",
    "loop.run_until_complete(main())\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, `asyncio.gather` is used to schedule multiple coroutines to run concurrently. When `main` is awaited, it waits for all scheduled tasks to complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, asynchronous programming can make your programs more efficient by allowing them to do other work while waiting for I/O operations to complete. It's a powerful tool that can greatly improve the performance of your Python applications."

    "Problem: Creating an Asynchronous Web Scraper in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In the field of web development, web scraping is an essential technique used for extracting data from websites. However, when dealing with a large number of websites or pages, executing requests serially can be time-consuming. Asynchronous programming can help in these situations by allowing multiple requests to be made concurrently, thus improving the efficiency of the scraper.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to create an asynchronous web scraper that fetches data from multiple URLs concurrently. You should use Python's native async and await keywords, and aiohttp, an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework built on asyncio.\n",
    "\n",
    "Requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The web scraper should accept a list of URLs to scrape.\n",
    "2. The scraper should be able to fetch the data from these URLs concurrently, not serially.\n",
    "3. For each URL, the scraper should return the HTML content of the page.\n",
    "4. Handle any exceptions that may occur during the process, such as a request failing to complete.\n",
    "5. Lastly, test your scraper's performance and efficiency by comparing it with a synchronous scraper.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: You may need to use aiohttp.ClientSession(), which is an object that encapsulates connection pooling and session-wide settings, and aiohttp.request(), a function to create a request object.\n",

    "Note: For the purpose of this problem, you can use any URLs to test, but be sure to check and respect the Robots Exclusion Standard (robots.txt) of the websites you are scraping. \n",
