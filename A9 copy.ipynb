    "# Conceptual Understanding of Asynchronous Programming in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Asynchronous Programming?\n",
    "\n",
    "To put it simply, asynchronous programming is a programming paradigm that allows for tasks to run concurrently instead of sequentially. This might sound a bit complex at first, but let's break it down using a metaphor that might make it easier to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A Real-life Metaphor\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a psychologist running a group therapy session. In a synchronous mode of operation, the psychologist would focus on one patient at a time. They would ask a question, the patient would respond, and only after the conversation with the first patient is done, would the psychologist move on to the next patient. This could be time-consuming, especially if one patient takes a long time to respond. In the meantime, the other patients are just waiting for their turn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, consider an asynchronous mode of operation. In this scenario, the psychologist poses a question to the first patient but doesn't wait for the answer. Instead, they immediately move on to the second patient and pose a similar question, and then to the third, and so on. While the psychologist is asking the next patient, the first patient is thinking about their response. Once the patient is ready with their response, they signal the psychologist who then handles the response and can ask a follow-up question if needed. This way, the psychologist is able to manage multiple conversations at once, making the overall process more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Asynchronous programming works in a similar way. Instead of waiting for one task to complete before starting the next (synchronous programming), asynchronous programming allows a task to wait in the background while other tasks are being executed. This way, the program can handle multiple tasks at once, leading to more efficient use of resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Event Loop and Callbacks\n",
    "\n",
    "Two key components of asynchronous programming are the event loop and callbacks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Extending our metaphor, the event loop would be like the psychologist's process of going around the room, asking each patient a question, and then moving on to the next one. The loop continues until all patients have been addressed.\n",
    "\n",
    "A callback, on the other hand, would be the signal a patient gives when they are ready to share their response. In programming terms, a callback is a function that gets executed once a task has completed. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Use Asynchronous Programming?\n",
    "\n",
    "As with our group therapy metaphor, the advantage of asynchronous programming is efficiency. It allows you to handle multiple tasks concurrently, which can greatly improve the performance of your program, especially when dealing with IO-bound tasks such as network requests or file operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, understanding asynchronous programming is like understanding how a skilled psychologist can handle multiple patients in a group therapy session. It's about efficiency and the ability to handle multiple tasks concurrently rather than sequentially. By harnessing the power of asynchronous programming, you can write Python code that is more efficient and performs better."

    "# Asynchronous Programming in Python: Syntax Breakdown\n",
    "\n",
    "## The `async` and `await` Keywords\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main components of asynchronous programming in Python is the use of the `async` and `await` keywords. These keywords allow Python to handle asynchronous tasks in a more efficient manner. Let's examine these keywords in more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `async def` keyword\n",
    "\n",
    "The `async def` keyword is used to declare an asynchronous function (or coroutine).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "async def my_function():\n",
    "    # Function body goes here\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `my_function` is an asynchronous function. You can call this function like any other function. However, it won't actually run the function's body. Instead, it will return a coroutine object.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "coroutine_obj = my_function()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This coroutine object represents the execution of the function. It doesn't do anything on its own. To actually run the function's code, the coroutine object needs to be `await`ed. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The `await` keyword\n",
    "\n",
    "The `await` keyword is used inside an `async def` function to suspend the function's execution until the awaited task is complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "async def my_function():\n",
    "    # await can only be used inside an async function\n",
    "    result = await some_other_async_function()\n",
    "    # The rest of the function will execute once some_other_async_function() is done\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, the `await` keyword is used to pause the execution of `my_function` until `some_other_async_function` is done. Only then, the rest of `my_function` will execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The function that `await` is used in must be an `async def` function. If you use `await` in a non-async function, Python will raise a `SyntaxError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Concurrent Execution with `asyncio.gather()`\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's asyncio library provides several functions to run multiple coroutines concurrently. One of them is `asyncio.gather()`. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import asyncio\n",
    "\n",
    "async def first_function():\n",
    "    # Some async code here\n",
    "\n",
    "async def second_function():\n",
    "    # Some other async code here\n",
    "\n",
    "# Run both functions concurrently\n",
    "await asyncio.gather(first_function(), second_function())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code above, `asyncio.gather()` is used to run `first_function` and `second_function` concurrently. The `await` keyword is used to pause the execution of the program until both functions are done.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The `async` and `await` keywords are the core of Python's asynchronous programming syntax. They allow you to define and control asynchronous tasks. The `asyncio.gather()` function can be used to run multiple asynchronous tasks concurrently. \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, the main difference between synchronous and asynchronous programming is that, in synchronous, tasks run one after the other while in asynchronous, tasks have the ability to run concurrently. This can greatly increase the efficiency of your program, especially when dealing with I/O-bound tasks such as network requests or file operations."

    "await process_all_patients(patient_ids)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Note:\n",
    "# These examples are simplified for educational purposes. In a real-world scenario, you would need to add error handling and other considerations.\n",
    "# Asynchronous programming can make your programs more efficient by allowing them to do multiple things at the same time. However, it also makes your programs more complex and harder to debug. Therefore, it should be used judiciously.\n",

    "Problem: \n",
    "\n",
    "As a psychology student, you often deal with a vast amount of data. One of your tasks involves performing sentiment analysis on a large number of text files to determine the overall sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of the text within each file. The process of reading each file, performing the sentiment analysis, and then storing the results is time-consuming if done synchronously (one after the other).\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to use asynchronous programming in Python to optimize this process. Specifically, you need to design an asynchronous Python program that can read in multiple text files concurrently, perform sentiment analysis on each file simultaneously, and store the results. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the sentiment analysis, you can use any Python library you prefer (e.g., TextBlob). The main focus here is on the application of asynchronous programming, not on the actual sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Requirements:\n",
    "1. Your program should be able to handle at least 100 text files concurrently.\n",
    "2. The results should be stored in a manner that associates each sentiment result with the corresponding file (e.g., a dictionary where the keys are file names and the values are sentiment results).\n",
    "3. Your program should handle any errors that might occur during the file reading or sentiment analysis process without crashing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: \n",
    "You don't have to provide real text files. You can mock this part by using simple text strings or by generating text files in your program. However, your solution should be applicable to real text files in a real-world scenario."
