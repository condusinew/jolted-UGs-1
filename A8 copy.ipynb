    "## A Metaphorical Understanding of Asynchronous Programming in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you are an event planner organizing multiple events at the same time. Each event represents a Python task. While organizing one event (let's say, a wedding), you receive a call to confirm the details of another event (a birthday party) that you're planning. Now, you have two options. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Synchronous Approach (Traditional way)**: You stop everything you're doing for the wedding, take the call, confirm the birthday party details, and then resume your wedding tasks. This is a blocking approach; you are not doing anything else while you're on the call. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Asynchronous Approach**: You hire an assistant. When the call for the birthday party comes in, you ask your assistant to take the call and confirm the details while you continue with the wedding tasks. If your assistant has a question they can't handle, they will interrupt you, get the answer, and then continue with their work. This way, both the wedding tasks and the birthday party confirmation are happening simultaneously. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the assistant is the event loop in asynchronous programming. While your main function is running (organizing the wedding), it delegates some tasks to the event loop (your assistant), which handles them concurrently. The event loop has a list of tasks (calls to answer, emails to respond to, etc.) and it keeps working on these tasks without blocking the main function. \n",
    "\n",
    "The event loop uses something called 'coroutines'. These are special functions that can be paused and resumed, allowing the event loop to multitask. When the event loop encounters a task that can't be completed immediately (like waiting for a response to an email), it can pause that task (coroutine), work on other tasks in the meantime, and then resume the paused task once it's ready to be completed. This is how the event loop achieves multitasking and improves efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "This metaphorical view should help you visualize the asynchrony of Python's asynchronous programming model. In subsequent sections, we will explore the actual Python constructs that enable this asynchrony, such as 'async', 'await', 'async for', 'async with', and the asyncio library.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, the goal of asynchronous programming is to improve the efficiency of your Python programs by allowing multiple tasks to be performed concurrently, rather than sequentially. Just like an efficient event planner, your Python program should be able to handle multiple tasks at the same time without unnecessary delays. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the next section, we will look at how to define and manage tasks (coroutines) and how the event loop schedules and executes these tasks. We will also discuss how to handle errors and exceptions in asynchronous programming, and how to synchronize and coordinate tasks to ensure correct and efficient execution of your program. This is where the real fun begins!"

    "# A Detailed Breakdown of Asynchronous Programming Syntax in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In this module, we will dissect a concrete example of the syntax of asynchronous programming in Python. We will cover the key constructs like `async`, `await`, `async for`, `async with`, and `asyncio.run()`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin with a simple example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import asyncio\n",
    "\n",
    "async def main():\n",
    "    print('Hello')\n",
    "    await asyncio.sleep(1)\n",
    "    print('World')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Python 3.7+\n",
    "asyncio.run(main())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## async and await\n",
    "\n",
    "The `async` and `await` keywords are the heart of asynchronous programming in Python. They are used to define and call asynchronous functions, respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, `async def main():` is used to define an asynchronous function `main`. The `await` keyword is then used before `asyncio.sleep(1)` to indicate that the program should wait for this function to complete before moving to the next line. \n",
    "\n",
    "## asyncio.sleep()\n",
    "\n",
    "`asyncio.sleep()` is a function that simulates IO-bound tasks in this example. The argument represents the number of seconds to \"sleep\" or pause the execution of the program. This is typically used for simulating network latency or other types of IO delays.\n",
    "\n",
    "## asyncio.run()\n",
    "\n",
    "`asyncio.run()` is a function that serves as the main entry point for running coroutines and other asyncio-based tasks. In our example, it is used to run the `main()` coroutine. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: `asyncio.run()` cannot be used when the event loop is already running. This happens when `asyncio.run()` is called from another asynchronous function.\n",
    "\n",
    "## async for\n",
    "\n",
    "The `async for` construct is used for asynchronous iteration. Let's see a quick example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "async def ticker(delay, to):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Yield numbers from 0 to `to` every `delay` seconds.\"\"\"\n",
    "    for i in range(to):\n",
    "        yield i\n",
    "        await asyncio.sleep(delay)\n",
    "\n",
    "async def main():\n",
    "    async for number in ticker(1, 5):\n",
    "        print(number)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Python 3.7+\n",
    "asyncio.run(main())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `async for` is used to asynchronously iterate over the generator returned by `ticker()`. The `ticker()` function is defined as an asynchronous generator because it includes both `yield` and `await`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## async with\n",
    "\n",
    "The `async with` statement is used for asynchronous context management. This is typically used when working with resources that require setup and teardown phases. Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class AsyncContextManager:\n",
    "    async def __aenter__(self):\n",
    "        print('entering context')\n",
    "    \n",
    "    async def __aexit__(self, exc_type, exc, tb):\n",
    "        print('exiting context')\n",
    "\n",
    "async def main():\n",
    "    async with AsyncContextManager():\n",
    "        print('inside context')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Python 3.7+\n",
    "asyncio.run(main())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `AsyncContextManager` is an asynchronous context manager. It defines two special methods: `__aenter__` and `__aexit__`, which are called when entering and exiting the context, respectively. The `async with` statement is used to manage this context in the `main()` coroutine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this detailed explanation, you should now have a solid understanding of the syntax of asynchronous programming in Python. It is important to remember that while the syntax may seem complex at first, with practice, it becomes more intuitive."

    "# Example 1: Web Scraping using Asynchronous Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we'll demonstrate how to speed up the process of web scraping by making HTTP requests concurrently using Python's asynchronous programming features.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import aiohttp\n",
    "import asyncio\n",
    "\n",
    "async def fetch(session, url):\n",
    "    async with session.get(url) as response:\n",
    "        return await response.text()\n",
    "\n",
    "async def main():\n",
    "    urls = [\"http://python.org\", \"http://google.com\", \"http://yahoo.com\", \"http://bing.com\"]\n",
    "    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:\n",
    "        tasks = [fetch(session, url) for url in urls]\n",
    "        return await asyncio.gather(*tasks)\n",
    "\n",
    "responses = asyncio.run(main())\n",
    "for url, response in zip(urls, responses):\n",
    "    print(f\"URL: {url}, Response Length: {len(response)}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, `fetch()` is a coroutine that fetches a URL and returns its contents as a string. The `main()` function creates a session and a list of tasks that fetch each URL concurrently. `asyncio.run(main())` is used to run the main coroutine and get the responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example 2: Asynchronous Database Queries\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you're developing an application that frequently interacts with a database. By using asynchronous programming, you can make multiple database queries concurrently, thus improving the performance of your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import asyncio\n",
    "import aiomysql\n",
    "\n",
    "async def get_user_by_id(id):\n",
    "    conn = await aiomysql.connect(host='localhost', port=3306, user='root', password='password', db='mydb', loop=loop)\n",
    "    async with conn.cursor() as cur:\n",
    "        await cur.execute(f\"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {id}\")\n",
    "        print(await cur.fetchone())\n",
    "    conn.close()\n",
    "\n",
    "async def main():\n",
    "    tasks = [get_user_by_id(id) for id in range(1, 100)]\n",
    "    await asyncio.gather(*tasks)\n",
    "\n",
    "loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()\n",
    "loop.run_until_complete(main())\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, `get_user_by_id()` is a coroutine that fetches a user from the database by their ID. The `main()` function creates a list of tasks that fetch each user concurrently. `loop.run_until_complete(main())` is used to run the main coroutine and print the users.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that not every function or method can be made asynchronous. A function can only be asynchronous if it supports being paused and resumed. Libraries like `aiohttp` and `aiomysql` provide this support for HTTP requests and MySQL queries, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Asynchronous programming can improve the performance of your Python applications significantly, especially when dealing with I/O-bound tasks. However, it's also more complex and harder to debug than synchronous programming, so it should be used judiciously."

    "Problem Statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "As a budding computer scientist, you have been tasked with developing a web scraper to collect data from multiple websites simultaneously. Given that the nature of web scraping involves a lot of waiting for IO operations, asynchronous programming can be very beneficial in this context to improve the efficiency of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, you are required to write an asynchronous Python program using the 'aiohttp' and 'asyncio' libraries for fetching the HTML data from a list of URLs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your program should:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Take a list of URLs as input.\n",
    "2. Create an asynchronous function, 'fetch_data' that takes a URL and a session as parameters. This function should use the session to fetch the HTML data from the URL.\n",
    "3. Create another asynchronous function, 'main', that creates a 'ClientSession', iterates over the list of URLs and for each of them, it calls 'fetch_data' function. Use 'asyncio.gather' to ensure that the requests are made concurrently.\n",
    "4. Finally, use 'asyncio.run' to run the 'main' function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Focus on handling exceptions properly to ensure your scraper continues with the next URL when an error occurs, instead of crashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, the goal of this task is not just to write a program that works, but to leverage asynchronous programming to make the program efficient by allowing concurrent execution of the IO-bound tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Do not perform any actual web scraping or HTML processing in this problem. Just fetch the HTML data and print it. Also, be careful to respect the terms of service of any real-world website you use for testing.\n",

    "\n",
    "Constraints:\n",

    "While testing your program, do not send requests to any single website more than once per second to avoid getting blocked."
